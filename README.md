# htmlEditor

**functionality**
This is code for a school assignment. It's a very basic editor for HTML. 

* Add closing tag when pressing Tab
* Check if every tag has a corresponding closing/opening tag
* Undo/Redo functionality 

**Remarks**
* checking HTML syntax assumes every tag has a closing tag, so it doens't work well with tags for newline (break) or a horizontal rule or similar tags that don't have a corresponding closing tag.
* checking HTML (can) generate errors for correct tags following a syntax error in your document 
* The only limit for the number of steps that can be undone/redone is your (RAM) memory size
